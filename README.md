## Data Visualization
There are several techniques you can use to visualize data using Python. Some common options include:

****1.  Matplotlib**:** Matplotlib is a popular library for data visualization in Python. It provides a range of plotting functions that can be used to create a variety of graphs, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, and pie charts.
    
**2.  Seaborn:** Seaborn is a library for data visualization in Python that is built on top of Matplotlib. It provides a range of advanced plotting functions and features, such as heatmaps, pair plots, and violin plots.
    
**3.  Plotly:** Plotly is an open-source library for data visualization in Python that provides a range of interactive plots and charts. It is particularly useful for creating online dashboards or interactive visualizations that can be shared and embedded in websites.
    
**4.  Bokeh:** Bokeh is a library for data visualization in Python that is designed to create interactive plots and charts. It is particularly useful for creating web-based visualizations that can be easily embedded in websites.
    
**5.  Altair:** Altair is a library for data visualization in Python that is based on the Vega-Lite visualization grammar. It is particularly useful for creating interactive visualizations that can be easily customized and exported to various formats.
